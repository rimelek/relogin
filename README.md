# R.E. Login

Just a hobby project, NOT FOR PRODUCTION!.

## History

R.E. Login was started in 2006 as a project which helped me to learn about PHP as beginner.
It became popular mainly among other beginners, and people still find me from time to time
to ask me if I would ever continue the project.

I don't encourage anyone to use R.E. Login today, but now, in 2022, 11 years after abandoning this project,
I decided to add some fixes to make it work in a container with older PHP versions as a demonstration
how Docker can help us, and then make it work with recent PHPs as well.

Other possible improvement could be and probably will be translating it to English.

## Recommended alternatives

This is only a hobby project, so if you are looking for a stable library to authenticate your users,
try some frameworks like [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) or [Laravel](https://laravel.com/),
or search for a similar tool on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/).
